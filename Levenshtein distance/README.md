## Levenshtein distance

In information theory, linguistics, and computer science,
the **Levenshtein distance** is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.
The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
It is named after Soviet mathematician _Vladimir Levenshtein_, who defined the metric in 1965.
