## Horner's method

**Horner's method** (**Horner's scheme**) is an algorithm for polynomial evaluation.
Given a value of variable $x$ it allows evaluating a polynomial of the form 
$P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0$
in $O(n)$ operations, instead of $O(n^2)$ operations required by the naive method.
